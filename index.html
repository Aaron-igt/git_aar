    <h1>Python</h1>
    Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[31]

    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.<br />It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[32][33]
    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000.<br /> Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[35]
    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[36][37][38][39]
