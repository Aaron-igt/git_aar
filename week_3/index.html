   <h1>the 300 army film</h1>
   <p>300 is a <em>2006 American epic historical action film</em>[4][5] based on the 1998 comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley.
    Co-written and directed by Zack Snyder,
    with <strong>serving as executive producer and consultant</strong>, the film is, like its source material, 
    a fictionalized retelling of the <q>Battle of Thermopylae in the Greco-Persian Wars</q>.
    The plot revolves around <u>King Leonidas (Gerard Butler)</u>, 
    who leads 300 Spartans into battle against <br />the Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers.
    As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey)
    attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband.</p>
